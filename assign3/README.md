# Assignment 3

Implement a script with Python and OpenCV that computes a depth map from at least three images. Write a readme file that
explains what you have done and how to run the script and what the script does.

## Getting started

To install all required dependencies consult [this](../README.md#setup) section.

All dependencies (which include indirect dependencies) and their exact version numbers can be found in
[requirements.txt](../requirements.txt). After the installation of the dependencies, we `cd` into the `assign2` folder

```shell
cd assign3
```

## Usage

For a quick overview of all commands run

```shell
python main.py --help
```

To retrieve usage information on each subcommand run

```shell
python main.py <COMMAND> --help
```
